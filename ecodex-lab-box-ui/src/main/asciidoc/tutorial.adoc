= Tutorial on the usage of the e-CODEX lab box
:toc:

The e-CODEX lab box has the intention to show first-timers in e-CODEX how the e-CODEX technical components (building-blocks) in an e-CODEX envrionment are working.

It gives the possibility to easily set-up so called "lab environments" which are pre-configured to communicate with each other.

There is also a test message prepared in each new lab environment which is easy to trigger to be sent to another lab environment.
This way a user can follow the route of one message between working e-CODEX environments.
