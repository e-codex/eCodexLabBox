This ecodex-lab-box is intended to give a showcase on how ecodex communication with the standard components works.

IT IS STRICTLY NOT INTENDED FOR BEING USED IN A PRODUCTIVE ENVIRONMENT!

Please leave the directory structure as is, since the configuration of the lab-box is relying on that structure.

Before starting, it is important that you have a JAVA version 8 or higher installed and system environmen variable JAVA_HOME is set!

To start working with the lab box use the "start.bat" script on top level.
This will start the user interface of the lab-box.
Once started, it should open the user interface in a standard browser window.
If that does not work, please open a browser window and call
http://localhost:8888
